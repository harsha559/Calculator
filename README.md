# Calculator


### Hereâ€™s a more detailed description:

"If we have two input fields, users can enter numbers into these fields. The application provides several buttons for different arithmetic operations. 

1. **Add (+) Button:** When the user clicks on this button, the application will calculate the sum of the two numbers entered in the input fields and display the result.

2. **Subtract (-) Button:** When the user clicks on this button, the application will subtract the second number from the first number and display the difference as the result.

3. **Multiply (*) Button:** When the user clicks on this button, the application will multiply the two numbers entered in the input fields and display the product as the result.

4. **Divide (/) Button:** When the user clicks on this button, the application will divide the first number by the second number and display the quotient as the result. If the second number is zero, the application should handle this by displaying an error message or indicating that division by zero is not possible.

5. **Clear Button:** When the user clicks on this button, all input fields will be cleared, resetting the application to its initial state with no numbers or results displayed."

This description clarifies the functionality and provides more context for each operation.
